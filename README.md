# EmuLinker-K

EmuLinker-K is a server that uses the Kaillera protocol to facilitate online multiplayer for emulators.

EmuLinker-K is a Kotlin rewrite of [EmulinkerSF](https://github.com/God-Weapon/EmuLinkerSF), with an emphasis on measuring and improving performance, patching security and privacy vulnerabilities, and adding useful features for both server owners and users.  EmuLinker-K is maintained by [nue](https://twitter.com/6kRt62r2zvKp5Rh).

Feel free to file bugs and feature requests on this repository, or find our channel in the Kaillera Reborn discord:
