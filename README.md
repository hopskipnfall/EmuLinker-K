# EmuLinkerSF-netsma

EmuLinkerSF-netsma (ネトスマ) is a SSB64-specific (originally just Japan-focused) fork of [EmulinkerSF](https://github.com/God-Weapon/EmuLinkerSF), which again is a fork of [EmuLinker](https://github.com/monospacesoftware/emulinker).

The aim of this repository is to:

- Add new features useful to SSB64 netplay.
- Modernize the codebase and fix vulnerabilities while maintaining or increasing the level of performance.

EmuLinkerSF-netsma is maintained by [jonnjonn](https://twitter.com/6kRt62r2zvKp5Rh).

## Development

From the root directory, the following commands are supported:

| Command                          | Description             |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `./gradlew clean`                | Clean build resources.  |
| `./gradlew compileKotlin`        | Compile the code.       |
| `./gradlew spotlessApply`        | Run the formatter.      |
| `./gradlew spotlessCheck`        | Run the linter.         |
| `./gradlew test`                 | Run tests.              |
| `./gradlew jar -PprodBuild=true` | Build the jar for PROD. |
| `./gradlew run`                  | Run the server locally. |

## Deployment

```kt
// TODO(nue): Write deployment steps here.
```

Note: If you use non-ASCII characters in the `conf/language.properties` file, you need to run with at least Java 9 for the characters to appear correctly.

### Docker

Docker support is WIP.

To run locally with Docker:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

To run locally with Docker and a local Graphite instance to monitor metrics (note: you need to also set `metrics.enabled=true` in emulinker.cfg):

```
docker-compose --profile=debug up -d
```

You can then access the Graphite dashboard at http://localhost/dashboard
